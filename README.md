Library Management System - Database Design Documentation
Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database schema for a Library Management System using MySQL Workbench. The goal is to create a well-structured, normalized database model capturing entities, relationships, and constraints necessary to manage books, authors, patrons, and transactions effectively.

Tools Used
•	MySQL Workbench: For designing the database schema, creating tables, defining relationships, and generating the EER diagram.
•	MySQL Server: For database hosting and execution of SQL scripts.

Database Schema Design
Entities and Tables
1.	Authors
o	Attributes: AuthorID (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment), Name (VARCHAR)
o	Purpose: To store information about book authors.
2.	Books
o	Attributes: ISBN (Primary Key, VARCHAR(13)), Title, PublicationDate (DATE), AuthorID (Foreign Key referencing Authors)
o	Purpose: To store book details and link to the author.
3.	Patrons
o	Attributes: PatronID (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment), Name (VARCHAR)
o	Purpose: To maintain records of library members.
4.	Transactions
o	Attributes: TransactionID (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment), PatronID (Foreign Key referencing Patrons), ISBN (Foreign Key referencing Books), BorrowDate (DATE), ReturnDate (DATE, Nullable)
o	Purpose: To track borrowing and returning of books by patrons.
________________________________________
Relationships and Constraints
•	Foreign keys establish links between related tables to maintain referential integrity:
o	Books.AuthorID → Authors.AuthorID
o	Transactions.PatronID → Patrons.PatronID
o	Transactions.ISBN → Books.ISBN
•	Referential actions like ON DELETE RESTRICT and ON UPDATE RESTRICT are used to protect data consistency by preventing deletion or modification of records in parent tables that are referenced by child tables.
________________________________________
ER Diagram
•	An Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram was created to visually represent the tables and relationships.
•	Tables were arranged logically with master entities (Authors, Patrons) positioned above the dependent entities (Books, Transactions).
•	The EER diagram shows primary keys, foreign keys, and connections, enabling clear understanding of the database structure.
________________________________________
Database Implementation
•	Tables created in MySQL Workbench with appropriate data types and primary/foreign key constraints.
•	Guidance and support provided to insert, view, and verify sample data.
•	The EER diagram was exported in PDF and SVG formats for documentation and sharing purposes.
________________________________________
Next Steps
•	Forward engineer the schema to deploy the database on MySQL server.
•	Insert sample dataset and implement stored procedures or triggers if necessary.
•	Develop application logic interfacing with the database for full library management functionality.
•	Maintain and update the database schema as new requirements evolve.

Conclusion
This project successfully establishes a solid foundation for a Library Management System database by:
•	Designing a normalized schema with clear entities and relationships.
•	Using MySQL Workbench tools effectively to model, visualize, and export the schema.
•	Preparing documentation that supports further development and deployment.
This documentation can be included in your project repository to guide future developers and stakeholders.
